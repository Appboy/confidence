# How It Works

**Confidence.js** provides two methods for calculating the statistical significance of an A/B Test:
- The Z-Test Method
- Chi Square Test and Marasciilo's Procedure

Both methods have advantages depending on your particular use case. This document describes the algorithms in details, and highlights the advantages of each.

## Chi Square Test and Marascuilo's Procedure

This method evaluates the variants in your A/B test using the [Chi Square Test and Marascuilo's Procedure](http://www.prenhall.com/behindthebook/0136149901/pdf/Levine_CH12.pdf). It's primarily used for tests with two or more variants, and often needs less data than The Z-Test Method to determine a winning variant.
